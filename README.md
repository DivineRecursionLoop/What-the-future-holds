# What-the-future-holds
What does the future hold for me?

Considering my past mistakes I have no idea. but right now I am not focusing on any technology.

From now on, I'll be focusing on the audio of the original av 1611 king James version to hear its cadences and patterns and cycles.
It was meant to be heard not just read.

God said he would preserve his Bible in isaiah. well.well.
The one he preserved is the one with the old spellings that was spoken in a cadence.

I'm already discovering some interesting things. Because I thought of the idea of numerology and Bible code and I'm excited to try to apply it. But in a different way through audi'm not articulating myself. Very well, but i'may have some cohesive documents in the future regarding this project other than that.  Pretty much done here.You know how to find me
